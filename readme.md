# Power BI Dashboard Development Process Optimization  

This project applies **Lean Six Sigma methodology** to optimize the Power BI dashboard development process.  
The objective is to reduce the average dashboard delivery time, minimize rework, and improve stakeholder satisfaction through **data-driven process improvement**.

## Overview  
The Business Intelligence (BI) team faced inefficiencies in delivering Power BI dashboards, with an average cycle time of **45 days**—**30% longer than the industry benchmark** of 32 days.  
This project focuses on analyzing and improving the process using the **DMAIC framework (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control)**.  

By implementing process mapping, standardization, and data collection methods, the project identifies and eliminates root causes of delays and rework in dashboard development.

## Problem Statement  
The dashboard development cycle currently averages **45 days**, exceeding the **industry benchmark of 32 days** by 30%.  

**Key findings:**  
- Rework rate: **15%** (adds ~7 days per project)  
- Stakeholder satisfaction (NPS): **6.2 / 10**  
- Annual productivity loss: **~€50,000**  

These inefficiencies impact decision-making, reduce delivery consistency, and lower stakeholder trust in BI outputs.  

---

## Business Case  
Optimizing the dashboard process supports faster analytics delivery, improved decision-making, and higher productivity.  

- Target: Reduce cycle time **45 → 32 days (-29%)**  
- Reduce rework rate **15% → 6%**  
- Improve stakeholder satisfaction **6.2 → 8.5**  
- Estimated annual savings: **€40,000**  
- Sigma level improvement: **2.8 → 3.5 Sigma**

## Project Scope  

**In Scope:**  
- Power BI dashboard development (internal stakeholders only)  
- Requirements gathering → deployment → training phases  
- Baseline measurement and data collection  

**Out of Scope:**  
- Infrastructure upgrades or licensing changes  
- Data warehouse redesign  
- Hiring or budget allocation decisions  

---

## Framework
- **Lean Six Sigma DMAIC framework** for process improvement  

---

## Methods  
- **Define Phase:** Project Charter, Stakeholder Analysis, Problem Definition  
- **Measure Phase:** SIPOC Diagram, Process Flow Mapping, Data Collection Plan  
- **Analyze Phase:** Root cause identification, Hypothesis development  
- **Improve Phase:** Recommendations for workflow automation and standardization  
- **Control Phase (Future):** KPI monitoring through BI dashboards  

---

## Key Insights  
- Requirements gathering takes **12 days** (vs. 5-day benchmark) due to lack of templates and repeated clarifications.  
- Approval and review loops add **3–5 extra days** per project.  
- **15%** of projects experience rework during UAT, mainly due to unclear requirements.  
- Standardization and Agile sprints can reduce total cycle time by nearly **30%**.

## How to Run This Project  
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.  
2. Open the notebook: **`SIX_SIGMA_YELLOW_BELT_CAPSTONE_PROJECT.ipynb`**  
3. Review sections for:  
   - Project Charter  
   - Team Charter  
   - Data Collection Plan  
   - Process Maps (SIPOC and Flowchart)  
   - Hypothesis Framework  
4. Use Power BI or Excel to replicate cycle time, rework, and satisfaction tracking.  

---

## Results and Conclusion  
Baseline analysis shows:  
- **Cycle Time:** 45 days average  
- **Rework Rate:** 15%  
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction:** 6.2 / 10  

Proposed improvements—standardized templates, automated workflows, and Agile methods—are projected to:  
- Reduce cycle time by **29%**  
- Cut rework by **60%**  
- Improve satisfaction from **6.2 → 8.5**  
- Save approximately **€40,000 annually**  

This project demonstrates how Six Sigma principles can effectively optimize data and analytics processes in a business environment.  

---

## Future Work  
- Implement recommendations in a pilot BI team.  
- Conduct post-implementation analysis to measure improvement (Green Belt phase).  
- Develop a live dashboard to monitor BI performance metrics (cycle time, NPS, rework rate).  
- Extend Six Sigma analysis to the **Control** phase for sustainable improvement.
